## Subject

Our assignment is about developing a friendly User Interface (UI) for a common, commercial coffee 
machine. The reasons that lead us choosing this particular device are:

- Making drinks (e.g coffee, tea, hot chocolate) is a simple and repetitive task for most users
- Most commercially available machines do not support generally requested features such as having
    a drink ready at a certain time each day
- Machines that do, make use of a primitive and often counter-intuitive interface
(e.g few, small buttons)
- Most machines support poorly people with visual disabilities

Our project strives to offer an easy-to-use, accessible interface supporting advanced features such
as automatic drink creation.  

This report is composed of 4 parts: The 1st, 2nd and 3rd development cycles of the project and an 
addendum where we place additional files and images pertaining to various development stages.


## 1st Cycle

The goals of the 1st development cycle are:

- Defining the base model on which the UI will be based
- Selecting and defining the features our prospective users will be interested in
- Producing mock-up versions of our various screens and menus
- Using the mock-ups to generate feedback from our users


### The model
The model we are using is the KRUPS coffee machine. It's an old model which specializes in producing
coffee and espresso. It can also technically produce hot chocolate and tea, so it fits our 
requirements.

This model is also notorious for its poor UI. All functions are defined using a lever and 4 small 
buttons which have to be pressed in non-obvious sequences. It goes without saying that it is also a 
nightmare for people with visual impairments.

### Target audience

Our target audience comprises of young students and professionals. 

- They are generally accustomed with technology and are thus more likely to choose a GUI rather than 
a traditional, tactile UI
- They make frequent, daily use of coffee 

We also focus on people with visual impairments, as accessibility is one of the greater strengths of 
designing a graphical user interface.


### Functional Requirements

- The system must support 4 kinds of drinks: french coffee/americano, espresso, tea and hot 
chocolate.
- The system must warn the user in case of missing or low ingredients (e.g water, filters)
- The system must save the last used drink configuration for each drink and load it when that drink
is requested.
- The system must support repeatable schedules where the user can request a drink be made at a specific time,
for a specific day.
- The system must support viewing, activating, deactivating and deleting schedules.
- The system must contain tutorials for each screen.


### Non-functional Requirements

- Each screen must be non-scrollable.
- For a given, ordinary task a maximum of 2 screens must be used.
- ...


### Verification

We used two forms of verification for the 1st development cycle;

- **Questionnaires**: Used to verify functional requirements and to gather general feedback about our 
design. Our questionnaire was given to 18 students, was comprised of 10 questions and was submitted 
using [Google Forms](https://forms.gle/RRxYVQZFafGN1ZDt6).

- **Interviews**: We used interviews where we asked participants to suggest features and give us feedback
about specific design decisions. The interviews were kept mostly open and unstructured as to allow
more general suggestions since the design was still in its early messages.

- **Group verification**: The project was presented to an audience of 15-20 people where many design
aspects were discussed (link power-point presentation here).

<!--- maybe add results for some questionnaire answers here --> 

### Results

<!---  TODO: Include main menu, schedule menu and one drink config screen with short descriptions-->
<!---  TODO: Include images for discarded ideas (old warning screen, custom preset menu) and why we dropped 
them-->

## Addendum

<!---  TODO: Include link to powerpoint presentation-->
<!---  TODO: Include the rest of the screens-->
